Author:C94Spots	AuthorChannelId:UCUivrmKcPIsNwNXrV9OuDaA	Comment:why people think it would end like that.... i think its gonna end like 1 of them would be dying and Sakura heals the person from the death .... ( but i doubt that ) its eather both die , both live and split ways or  1 dies with chance being healed by a restruction jutsu :P maybe tsunade gives her life :P ( hope for it beacause 1 kage must freaking die since gaara already did its onikuu or tsubade. )	PublishAt:2012-03-26T01:06:48.000Z

Author:VJ: IT'S TIME TO KICK IT!	AuthorChannelId:UCITaswQo8zPXLZ1rq1K1eeg	Comment:@Double4anime, Maybe but one thing for sure, he meat what he said. He can't be Hokage if he can't saved a friend. We all know that Tobi lied to Sasuke, anyway. And he using him as a pawn. I hope Naruto ripped Tobi in two.	PublishAt:2012-01-18T01:15:55.000Z

Author:TheRainbowTribe	AuthorChannelId:UCpd0bz4bMFaThzw9coR25Vg	Comment:@Double4anime lol, too true, but the Naruto world is a place where ninja's can actually get ahead by cheating so can we really fault him?  Even Naruto uses shadow clones to master things that should have taken more years according to the other ninjas.  Of course, the biggest slaps in the face are that Guy and Rock Lee have been relegated to comic relief, while Naruto is the "chosen" one, meaning hard work and determination really can't stand up to things like Kabuto, Uchihas, fate.

Author:The Fallen	AuthorChannelId:UC2ZC8a3AnEDz4nU203eD-hA	Comment:@Double4anime Seriously its like we get this big timeskip in Naruto yet we have yet to actually see what he learned which is the same with the others like Neji and the gang. Whereas with saskue he learns a bunch of diverse techniques which is BS. Its all Kishi's fault for his favoritism. Yea saskue had every single one of his fights handed to him and its a shame because ppl just seem to think sasue is SOO strong when he's NOT	PublishAt:2012-01-17T15:48:22.000Z

Author:ninjakid164	AuthorChannelId:UCvsTv3QdTWUZwviJBBd3Hqw	Comment:it'll be funny if  in the ending we find out all of this stuff already happened and its just someone reading a book about what happened to some people or sakura/hinata talking to kids about the legend of naruto. kind of like the books jiraiya wrote in his spare time.

Author:Coolbman2	AuthorChannelId:UCRfqU49FVUA-c0vXj6vhzMw	Comment:As a result Naruto will die from taking on such a burden and leave a huge impact on the ninja world (which will have become united after the war) his grave stone will be right next to sasukes and he'll have a stone face in the village next to tsunades. Sakura will become a jonin and the leader of a team of genin ninja that are just like Team 7 was in the beginning. 	PublishAt:2012-01-17T06:30:37.000Z
Author:Coolbman2	AuthorChannelId:UCRfqU49FVUA-c0vXj6vhzMw	Comment:My predicitions are that Naruto and the Kyuubi form a bond and Naruto fights and kills sasuke (who gained the rinnegan somehow through Itatchi but despite this loses to Naruto) giving him a funeral in the leaf village. Tobi is the Sage of six paths older son but is defeated by Naruto who put all 10 Biju inside of himself he said he'd "take in all the hatred in the ninja world to bring peace" Bijus are hatred "personified" you could say.

Author:Coolbman2	AuthorChannelId:UCRfqU49FVUA-c0vXj6vhzMw	Comment:Sasuke will die. Naruto will become Hokage, It's possible he will die, if he does die he'll go ouy with a bang and bring peace to the ninja world. I'd prefer it if he killed sasuke, manned up, and became Hokage with Shikamaru  as his right hand man. I'm curious to see how this (among the other things we're anticipating in Naruto) will end. It's personally going to make or break Naruto as a series for me. 	PublishAt:2012-01-17T06:16:45.000Z
Author:coolguitarchannel	AuthorChannelId:UCxKzn6as5BjMt7gxgQT3PAg	Comment:i pretty much agree that its really unrealistic for sasuke to come back to the village. and we all know that if sasuke isnt saved then naruto cant become hokage. i dont have a fucking clue of how naruto will save sasuke but i know that Kishimoto has something extremely awesome and unpredictable for that. (at least i hope so)	PublishAt:2012-01-17T05:29:36.000Z
Author:TheRainbowTribe	AuthorChannelId:UCpd0bz4bMFaThzw9coR25Vg	Comment:Actually, the Rinnegan would allow Sasuke to bring Naruto back to life after killing him.  Pein used it on the whole Leaf Village.  In fact, he could bring him back to life and kill him as many times as he wanted... but I think your depiction of him crying dramatically in regret before bringing him back to life has more class.  That is, assuming Sasuke found the trick for unlocking the Rinnegan like Madara did.	PublishAt:2012-01-17T05:12:00.000Z

Author:The Fallen	AuthorChannelId:UC2ZC8a3AnEDz4nU203eD-hA	Comment:Note: IMHO Saskue didnt win any fight that he's been in since they first fought in the Valley of the End. We all know Naruto could've won if he wanted to. All of saskue's fights have been handed to him, i mean its one thing to escape death but it is a another when the writer literally gives BS ways to save a charcter such as Saskue. While it is ok for a writer to have a favorite charcter, the writer should also never let that favoritism overshadow a story. Shame on you Kishi :(	PublishAt:2012-01-17T04:32:24.000Z
